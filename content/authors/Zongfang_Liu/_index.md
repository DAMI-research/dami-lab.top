I graduated from School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University with a Bachelor's degree in 2022. Currently, I'm a Vision Algorithm Engieer of the [Hybrid Video Solution Department](https://carrier.huawei.com/en/old-solutions/Service-reconstruction/hybrid-video), Huawei Nanjing Research & Development Center. My research interest is ML/DL algorithms and it's application. Besides, I'm passionate about using my algorithmic and programming skills to solve biological problems.

I have gone through a hard time and have taken many detours in the past. Fortunately, it's not too late to change. I will do my best to make it up in the future.

No way to return, is the way to victory.
